## Project instructions:

* Examine the relationship between size, price, and rating of apps using jointplot().
* Use a strip plot to visualize the distribution of paid apps across different categories.
* Filter out "junk" apps.
* Popularity of paid apps vs free apps: prep the data for a box plot that compares the number of installs of paid apps vs. number of installs of free apps: this figure shows that the number of downloads of free applications is higher than paid applications
